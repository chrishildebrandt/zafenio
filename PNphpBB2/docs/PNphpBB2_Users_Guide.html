<h1><A href="#TOC2" name="SEC2">1.0 Administration</A></h1>
<P>PNphpBB2 1.2x is highly configurable.&nbsp; Most configurations are done
            in the administration panel.&nbsp; To get to the administration panel,
            log in with an Administrator username and click the link that says <U>Go to Administration 
Panel</U> at the bottom of any page or click on the PNphpBB2 link in postnuke admin.<BR>The admin panel uses two frames.&nbsp; The narrow navigation frame on the left shows 
the sub-panels available.&nbsp; The main frame shows the panel you are currently 
using. <BR>
<BR>There are three uncategorized links at the top of the navigation 
frame: <BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Admin Index</U></B> is the default admin page.&nbsp; It shows 
<B>Forum Statistics</B> and <B>Who's Online</B>.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Forum 
Index</U></B> will take you to <B>index.php</B> in the PNphpBB2 1.2x root, which shows the list of forums. <BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Preview Forum</U></B> will also take you 
to the forum index, but will keep the navigation frame, making it easier to 
return to other parts of the admin panel.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><h3><A href="#TOC6" name="SEC6">1.3.1- Forum Management</A></h3>
The Forum Management panel is where most forum configuration is done.&nbsp;
Here you will control the organization of forums and categories.&nbsp;
Configuration of a forum's name, description, and auto-prune settings is
also handled here.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Adding Forums</B> - To create a new forum, look to the bottom of the category you want your
  new forum to be in.&nbsp; Enter the desired forum name in the text box
  at the bottom, and click <B>Create New Forum</B>.&nbsp; You will be taken to the <B>General Forum 
Settings</B> panel.&nbsp;
  <LI><B>Editing Forums</B> - To edit a forum, look in that forum's row and click <B><U>Edit</U></B>.&nbsp; You 
will be taken to the <B>General Forum Settings</B> panel.&nbsp; Here you may adjust 
the following settings: <B>Forum Name</B> - This is the name of the forum.&nbsp; 
(e.g. General Chat, Movie Reviews, Support, etc.) <br><br>
  <B>Description</B> - Describes your forum. This is the smaller text that appears under each forum name on the Forum Index. <br><br><B>Category</B> - A dropdown list box that will allow you to choose what category a forum is contained in. Forum Status - A dropdown list box that will allow you to lock or unlock a forum. A locked forum may not be posted to except by moderators and administrators.<br><br> <B>Auto-Pruning</B> - Here you can enable/disable auto-pruning. (For more information, see
  Auto-Prune or 3.1.3 Pruning).
  <LI><B>Moving Forums</B> - A forum's location can be described in two ways.&nbsp; A forum is in
  a category, and has a location relative to other forums in that category.&nbsp;
  To change the category that a forum is in, use the <B>General Forum Settings </B>panel, as 
described in <B>3 Editing Forums</B>. <BR>
  <BR>To change a forum's position 
relative to other forums in its category, use the <U>Move Up</U> and <U>Move 
Down</U> links in the <B>General Forum Settings</B> panel.&nbsp; <U>Move Up</U> will 
swap the position of the desired forum with the forum above it.&nbsp; <U>Move 
Down</U> will swap the position of the desired forum with the forum below it.&nbsp; 
<U>Move Up</U> has no effect on the top forum in a category, and, likewise, 
<U>Move Down</U> has no effect on the bottom forum.
  <LI><B>Resync</B> - Some information in the database is contained it multiple tables.&nbsp;
  This makes the board run faster by reducing the number of database queries
  on some pages.&nbsp; Sometimes the information in different tables of the
  database gets out of sync.&nbsp; This usually is caused by a connection
  problem which interrupts updating of the database. <BR>
  <BR>
  When this happens, your forum may 
start behaving in a strange way.&nbsp; Links to topics or posts that don't exist are 
common symptoms of this problem. <BR>
  <BR>
  If you are having this problem, you can 
fix it by clicking <U>Resync</U> in the <B>General Forum Settings</B> Panel.&nbsp; 
This will recalculate the forum information based on the actual posts that 
exist.&nbsp; This operation has no harmful effect on the forums, just generates a 
small amount of overhead while you are doing it.&nbsp; This is a good thing to try if 
you are not sure what is causing a problem on your board.
  <LI><B>Auto-prune</B> - Auto-prune is a feature that will cause a forum to prune itself.&nbsp;
  (For more information on what pruning is, see Pruning).&nbsp; To enable
  auto-prune, make sure the checkbox is checked. <BR>
  <BR>You may set the age of 
posts to prune.&nbsp; All posts older than the set age will be pruned.&nbsp; You may also 
set the frequency of pruning.&nbsp; For example, you could have the forums prune 
themselves once a day, or once every seven days
  <LI><B>Adding Categories</B> - To add a new category, look at the bottom of the forum/category listing.&nbsp;
  Enter the desired category name into the text box and click <B><U>Create New Category</U></B>.
  <LI><B>Editing Categories</B> - To move a category, click <U>Move Up</U> or <U>Move Down</U> in 
the category's row.&nbsp; <U>Move up</U> will swap the position of the desired 
category with the category above it.&nbsp; <U>Move Down</U> will swap the position of 
the desired category with the category below it.&nbsp; <U>Move Up</U> has no effect 
on the top category, and, likewise, <U>Move Down</U> has no effect on the bottom 
category.
  <LI><B>Moving Categories</B> - To move a category, click <U>Move Up</U> or <U>Move Down</U> in 
the category's row.&nbsp; <U>Move up</U> will swap the position of the desired 
category and the category above it.&nbsp; <U>Move Down</U> will swap the position of 
the desired category and the category below it.&nbsp; <U>Move Up</U> has no effect on 
the top category, likewise <U>Move Down</U> has no effect on the bottom 
category.
              <LI><B>Sub Categories </B>- To create a sub-category, you first create the category as you normally would and then you edit it to move it under another category.
            </OL>
<BLOCKQUOTE><h3><A href="#TOC7" name="SEC7">1.3.2 Forum Permissions</A></h3>
In this panel you can control the forum permissions.&nbsp; You can restrict

you can control who can read and post in a forum.&nbsp; You can also control
who can make special posts, like Sticky topics or announcements.&nbsp;
To edit a forum's permissions, select the forum in the dropdown box and
click <B>Look Up 
Forum</B>.<BR>
            <BR>

  a forum.&nbsp; To set advance permissions for your forum, click <U>Advanced Mode</U> after choosing the forum to edit.&nbsp; You are presented with a

  <LI><B><A name="pertype">Permission Types</A></B>
  <DIV class=body4>There are ten <B>Permission Types</B>.&nbsp; Each of these types 
refers to a specific behavior within a forum.&nbsp; This is the behavior that each of 
these permissions grants: <BR>

  <B>View</B> - The user may see the forum on 
the forum index page. <B>Read</B> - The user may view topics in a forum, and 
read posts in those topics. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Post</B> - The user may post new topics 
in the forum. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Reply</B> - The user may post replies to existing 
topics in the forum. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Edit</B> - The user may edit his/her own posts 
in the forum.&nbsp; It is not recommended that this be set to "ALL", because that 
will allow any anonymous post to be edited by any anonymous user. 
<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Delete</B> - The user may delete his/her own posts in the forum.&nbsp; A 
post can only be deleted by a non-moderator if it has not been replied to. It is 
not recommended that this be set to "ALL", because that will allow any anonymous 
post to be deleted by any anonymous user. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Sticky</B> - The user may 
make sticky Topics (for more information, see <A class="linkage" href="#SEC34">Sticky Topics</A>)

  <B>Vote</B> - The user may vote in Polls (for more 
information, see <A class="linkage" href="#SEC35">Polls</A>). It is not 
recommended that this be set to "ALL", because that will allow an anonymous user 
to vote more than once. <BR>

(for more information, see <A class="linkage" href="#SEC35">Polls</A>)</DIV>
  <LI><B><A name="perlevel">Permission Levels</A></B>
  <DIV class=body4>There are five permission levels.&nbsp; A user may be a member of 
more than one permission level.&nbsp; To be in each of the permission levels: 
<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>ALL</B> - Every user in the board is in this permission level.&nbsp; This 
level is used particularly to grant permissions to users who are not registered 
and/or logged in. <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>REG</B> - A user is in this permission level if 
he/she is both registered at the board, and is currently logged in. 
<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>PRIVATE</B> - There are two parts to being a private member of a 
forum.&nbsp; In the forum permissions, there must be at least one permission type set 
to the permission level <B>PRIVATE</B>.&nbsp; Additionally, in the User Permissions 
or Group Permissions panel, the user or group must be "Allowed Access" to the 
private forum (or have permission types set to "ON" in advanced mode.)&nbsp; For more 
information, see <A class="linkage" href="#SEC16"> Group Admin</A>. 
<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>MOD</B> - Someone is in this permission level if they are a moderator 
of the forum. <BR>

  <B>ADMIN</B> - Board administrators (and no one else) are 
in this permission level.</DIV>

  Allows administrator to 
display forum in either full page view or within the Postnuke theme.
              <LI><B>Use phpBB2 Compatibility mode</B><BR>
              This will set the forum to full page 
mode and allow you to utilize most phpBB2 templates/styles without minimal 
modifications. It uses the standard phpBB2 style sheets and resides outside of 
the Postnuke header and footers.
              <LI><B>Use Postnuke's Private messaging system</B><br>
              This will switch ALL the links to the private messaging system over to
              the ones used in Postnuke rather than use the forums PM system.

  <LI><B>Use the NEW template compiler</B><BR>
  Use the eXtreme Styles mod by Vjacheslav 
Trushkin <BR>This mod is heavily optimized version of phpBB 
templates system and has some additional features. It compiles and executes 
files much faster, has cache system that speeds up templates many times, allows 
to use php in templates and few other new features to style designers. This is a 
test version and might not work with some mods.
</OL>
<P><B>Categories Hierarchy settings</B></P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Allow users to switch category/sub-forum mode</B><BR>
  This will allow you to 
give your users the option of switching between sub-category, or sub-forum view. 
If you do not wish to use the sub-category/forum mod simply do not add 
sub-category/forums to your site.
  <LI><B>Display the sub-categories as forums</B><BR>Allows administrator to default 
to sub-forum view or sub-category view (vBulletin-like).
</OL>
<P><B>Announcement Settings</B></P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Display forum announcements on index</B><BR>

<P><B>eXtreme Styles mod v1.01 settings</B></P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Default template directory</B><BR>
  If tpl file is not found in current 
template directory (that might happen if you modded phpBB incorrectly) then 
template system will look for same file in this directory (like if current 
template is "myTemplate" and script requires file "myTemplate/myfile.tpl" and 
that file isn't there template system will look for that file as 
"subSilver/myfile.tpl"). Set to empty to disable this feature.
  <LI><B>Check switches while compiling</B><BR>
  This feature checks for errors in templates. Turning it off will speed
  up compilation, but compiler might skip some errors in templates if template
  has errors.<br>Smart check will check templates for errors and automatically
  fix all known errors (there are few known typos in different mods). Works
  little bit slower than simple check.<BR>
  <BR>
  But sometimes template looks properly only when error 
check is disabled. This happens because of bad html coding - contact whoever 
wrote tpl file if you want to fix errors.<BR>
  <BR>
  If cache feature is disabled 
then for faster compilation it is better to turn this off.
  <LI><B>Check variables with isset() in compiled code</B>
</OL>
<P><B>eXtreme Styles mod Cache configuration</B></P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Use cache</B><BR>
  Cache is saved to disk and it will speed up templates system 
many times because there would be no need to compile template every time it is 
shown.
  <LI><B>Cache directory</B><BR>
  All cache will be written in that directory (and/or 
sub directories). Files with same filenames will be overwritten. Do not put "/" 
before directory name unless directory name is absolute. Absolute means complete 
path as file is in server hard disk (do not mistake it for absolute URL). 
Relative means path starting with phpBB directory.
  <LI><B>Automatically save cache</B><BR>
  This will automatically compile templates if 
needed and save to cache directory.
  <LI><B>Automatically re-compile cache</B><BR>
  This will automatically re-compile 
cache if original template file was changed.
  <LI><B>Filename separator</B><BR>
  If set to "/" then cache will be saved in sub 
directories by template name (like file "subSilver/admin/page_header.php" would 
be saved to cache directory as "subSilver/admin/page_header.php"), if set to 
something else like "." then all cache will be saved to one directory (like file 
"subSilver/admin/page_header.php" would be saved to cache directory as 
"subSilver.admin.page_header.php")
  <LI><B>Extension of cache filenames</B><BR>This is extension of cached files. Files 
are stored in php format so default extension is "php". Do not include dot
</OL>
At the bottom of this page in admin is debug information for the eXtreme
Styles mod Cache configuration, this will be of use if you are having any
problems with it.<BR>

            <h2><A href="#TOC20" name="SEC20">1.7 Styles Admin</A></h2>
<P>The Theme Mod handles most of this function in PNphpBB2. Please read the docs on the <A href="PNphpBB2_mods.html" target="_blank">Theme Mod</A>. <BR>
            <B>Note: </B>This part of the module is under going revision, so for the most current information check the support forums.</P>
<DIV class=body2>Themes are the color/graphic information for a style.&nbsp; This includes
the font colors, background color and/or image, and much more.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Templates are the HTML-like files that are used to generate the output
HTML of PNphpBB2.&nbsp; They control the layout and organization of all
of the pages, using basic HTML and special template variables. <BR>
<BR>
So for a given template, you may have many themes.&nbsp; This results in
having many styles, each Style = Template + Theme.<BR>
            The PNphpBB2 Theme mod adds many functions in this area. <B><BR>
            PNTheme</B> - (included in the module) At default it uses an automatic color matching Theme in the forum that works to match the colors of the forum to the postnuke theme being used. You can also use custom themes in the forum that you match to corresponding postnuke themes or a special custom theme that uses the data from Styles management edit. In addition to better match postnuke themes, you can use custom cellpics, custom images or icons, custom posticons, and custom ranks. Although it may seem complicated at first its really simple to use. Read the <A href="PNphpBB2_mods.html" target="_blank">Theme Mod docs</A> for more details.<BR>

  <LI><B>Adding Styles</B> - This panel will allow you to add new styles.&nbsp; To add a new style,
  simply click <U>Install</U> in the appropriate row.&nbsp; This panel automatically detects uninstalled
  styles in your template directory. In PNphpBB2 this panel is mainly used
  to add new adapted templates or in the case of the out of postnuke templates
  - new phpbb2 styles.<br><br><B>Important: </B>When installing a new template(e.g. one that you downloaded), 
be sure that your new template directory is nested correctly in the 
<B>templates</B> directory.&nbsp; It also must have the correct name (case 
sensitive).&nbsp; For instance, if you had a new template named <I>subCheese</I>, 
then in the <B>templates</B> directory you should have a folder called 
"subCheese" (not "subcheese"), and in that folder will be all of your template 
files (*.tpl files).
  <LI><B>Creating Styles</B> -This part of the module is under going revision. In future version the
              ability to edit style sheets online and to preview them online will be
              added among with many other features. Currently as stated below this panel

<h3><A href="#TOC23" name="SEC23">1.8.1 Ban Control</A></h3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This panel allows you to ban users using several methods.&nbsp; This panel
also makes it easy to remove bans.
<OL>
  <LI><B>Banning by username</B>
  <DIV class=body4>When a username is banned, that user may no longer login to 
your board.&nbsp; When they login, they will be informed that they have been banned.&nbsp; 
The user may still view and read the board as a <B>Guest</B> (Anonymous User).&nbsp; 
To prevent a user from seeing your board at all, you must ban them by IP.&nbsp; For 
more information, see <A class="linkage" href="#banip"> Banning by IP or Hostname</A>. <BR>
  <BR>To ban by username, simply select the username(s) to ban 
in the <B>Ban one or more specific users</B> listbox.&nbsp; To ban more than one 
username at once, simply select all of the usernames you are trying to ban.&nbsp; 
This is normally accomplished by holding the <B>CTRL</B> key and clicking each 
name.&nbsp; When all of the desired names are selected, press <U>Submit</U> to add 
the ban information to the database. <BR>
  <BR>Similarly, to un-ban usernames, 
simply select the banned username(s) from the <B>Un-ban one or more specific 
users</B> listbox and press <U>Submit</U>.</DIV>
  <LI><A name="banip"><B>Banning by IP or Hostname</B></A>
  <DIV class=body4>When an IP or hostname is banned, your board's content will be 
blocked from any connection coming from that IP or host.&nbsp; Users from a banned IP 
will be informed of the ban, but may not view the board at all. <BR>
  <BR>To ban 
by IP or hostname, simply enter the IP address or hostname to ban and click 
<U>Submit</U>.&nbsp; To specify multiple IPs or hostnames, you may separate the 
multiple entries with commas (,).&nbsp; For instance, to ban the IP 
<I>192.168.8.19</I> and the hostname <I>banned.cheese.com</I>, you would enter 
<I>192.168.8.19,banned.cheese.com</I> <BR>
  <BR>You may also ban multiple IPs or 
hostnames using ranges and wildcard characters.&nbsp; To ban a range of IPs, use 
-(hyphen) (e.g. <I>192.168.8.19-124</I>).&nbsp; Banning a range of IPs will cause 
each IP in that range to be added to the list, so using specific IPs or 
wildcards is preferred.&nbsp; The wildcard *(asterisk) will match any characters, so 
to ban all IPs that begin with 192.168, use <I>192.168.*.*</I>&nbsp;&nbsp; This also works 
with hostnames.&nbsp; For example <I>*.cheese.com</I> will ban all hostnames that end 
with ".cheese.com" <BR>
  <BR>To un-ban IPs and hostnames, simply select the banned 
IP or hostname from the <B>Un-ban one or more IP addresses</B> listbox and press 
<U>Submit</U>.</DIV>
  <LI><B>Banning by email address</B>
  <DIV class=body4>Banning an email address prevents anyone from registering using 
that banned email address.&nbsp; Any users currently using a banned email will not be 
affected.&nbsp; To deny the user access to the board, you must still ban their 
username or delete their account.&nbsp; When someone tries to register with a banned 
email address, the registration will fail, and they will be informed that it 
failed due to a banned email address. <BR>
  <BR>To ban an email address, simply 
enter the email address to ban into the text field and click <U>Submit</U>.&nbsp; You 
may ban multiple addresses by separating them by commas.&nbsp; You may also use the 
wildcard *(asterisk) to ban email addresses meeting certain criteria.&nbsp; For 
instance, to ban all email addresses at hotmail.com, you would enter 
<I>*@hotmail.com</I> into the field. <BR>
  <BR>To un-ban email addresses, simply 
select the banned email address from the <B>Un-ban one or more email

This panel will allow you to specify usernames that you do not 
want other people to use.&nbsp; This is commonly used to prevent users from using 
profanity in their usernames.&nbsp; Another use is preventing users from 
impersonating board administrators by registering similar usernames.&nbsp; When 
someone tries to register using a name that has been disallowed, the 
registration will fail, and they will be informed that the username has been 
disallowed.

To disallow a username, simply enter it into the text field 
and click 
<U>Add</U>.&nbsp; You may use the wildcard *(asterisk) to match any 
character.&nbsp; For instance, to disallow all usernames that contain "cheese" (with

<h1><A href="#TOC28" name="SEC28">2.0 Using PNphpBB</A></h1>
<P>PNphpBB2 is postnuke forum module based on phpBB2 .&nbsp; It allows people
to post ideas, opinions, and information in an organized way.&nbsp; Posts
are organized in a way that makes it easy for people to find the information
they are interested in, but without having to wade through unrelated information.
<BR>
<BR>
Postings in PNphpBB2 are organized into three subdivisions: <BR>
<BR>
<B>Post</B> - A post is a piece of 
information submitted by a single user.&nbsp; It may be a new post, which starts a 
new topic, or a reply to an existing post.&nbsp; Posts are typically a sentence, 
paragraph, or a few paragraphs. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Topic</B> - A topic is a collection 
of posts.&nbsp; The posts are organized in chronological order.&nbsp; The idea of a topic 
is that there is a single post that contains the topic of discussion.&nbsp; The rest 
of the posts in the topic are replies to this first post and to other replies.&nbsp; 
Topics are sort of like conversations, allowing many people to state their 
opinions about an idea, or debate an issue. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Forum</B> - A forum is a 
container for topics.&nbsp; Forums often have a general subject that the topics 
within are about.&nbsp; For instance, you might have a <I>Movie Reviews</I> forum, 
which would contain topics in which people would discuss movies and their 
opinions about them. <BR>
<BR>
Navigating through posts in PNphpBB2 is based on the idea of posts, topics
and forums.&nbsp; Generally, a user will start at the <B>Forum Index </B>(index.php).&nbsp; The <B>Forum Index</B> shows a list of forums.&nbsp; 
If you click on one of the forums, you will be shown the <B>View Forum</B> page, 
which is a listing of the topics in the forum (viewforum.php).&nbsp; By default they 
are sorted in chronological order by the most recent post in each topic.&nbsp; If you 
click on a topic, you will be shown the <B>View Topic</B> page, which is a 
listing of the posts in that topic (viewtopic.php).&nbsp; The posts in a topic are 
organized chronologically, with the oldest post first.</P>
<h2><A href="#TOC29" name="SEC29">2.1 User Accounts</A></h2>
<P>The user accounts in PNphpBB2 are handled by postnuke. Registration and
logging in is by way of postnuke. The user information from postnuke is
added to PNphpBB2 the first time a member accesses the forum and is updated
at the start of each session in PNphpBB2. PNphpBB2 does have a limited
profile itself which deals with forum specific user preferences. See profile
below for more information.<BR>
</P>
<h2><A href="#TOC30" name="SEC30">2.2 Posting</A></h2>
<DIV class=body2>There are two primary ways to create a post.&nbsp; In the <B>View 
Forum</B> and <B>View Topic</B> pages, you may click <U>New Topic</U>.&nbsp; This 
will take you to the posting form, and, when you have posted, will create a new 
topic with your post as the first one in the topic.&nbsp; In the <B>View Topic</B> page you have two ways to <U>Reply to posts</U>.&nbsp;You can click on the<U> Reply</U> and this will take you to the posting form, and, when you have posted,
it will add your post to the topic you replied to.&nbsp; To reply to a
specific post, you may also click the <U>Quote</U> button in the upper right corner of that post.&nbsp;If you have it enabled,
you can also reply by way of the quick reply form on the <B>View Topic </B>Page itself.</DIV>

<h3><A href="#TOC37" name="SEC37">2.2.6 Smilies</A></h3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV class=body3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Smilies are small images that appear in posts.&nbsp; Usually they 
are small images of faces, and are often used to show emotion. <BR>
To use smilies in your posts, you need to enter a series of characters.&nbsp;
Common character series are :) for a happy face , :( for a sad face , etc.&nbsp;
Another common style for smilie character sequences is <I>:emotion:</I> (i.e. the emotion the smilie shows, with a colon &quot;:&quot; before
and after this).&nbsp; Examples of this are :wink: for a winking face ,
:lol: for a laughing face , etc. <BR>
<BR>
Many templates (including subSilver, the default template) have smilie 
buttons on the posting form.&nbsp; Normally, this is a grid of the smilies, any of 
which may be clicked to insert the appropriate character sequence at the current 
text insertion point.&nbsp; For more information, see <A class="linkage" href="#sec13"> Smilie Administration</A>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

To quote all of someone's post, look at the top right corner of 
their post and click <U>Quote</U>.&nbsp; This will take you to the posting form, and 
will allow you to reply to the post.&nbsp; It will also automatically add the 
appropriate <B>BBCode</B> to your post to quote the post you are replying to. 
<BR>
<BR>
The proper syntax to quote a post is: <BR>
<BR>
[quote="<I>&lt;name to 
quote&gt;</I>"]<I>&lt;text to quote&gt;</I>[/quote] <BR>
<BR>
<I>&lt;name to 
quote&gt;</I> is the source of your quote, and <I>&lt;text to quote&gt;</I> is 
what you are quoting.&nbsp; So to quote the user <I>Cheese Man</I> saying "Power the 
behold of cheese." <BR>

area of PNphpBB2. If the forum is set to use the PNphpBB2 PM system then
the information belows applies.</P>
<DIV class=body2>Private messages allow users on a board to contact each other out of the
public eye.&nbsp; Private messages can be described as a cross between
email, instant messaging, and PNphpBB2 forum posting. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> If attachments are enabled in the forum, you will be able to send attachments by way of private messages also.<BR>
<BR>To use private 
messaging, you must be logged in to the board.&nbsp; Look at the top of any page, and 
click <U>You have X new message(s)</U>.&nbsp; This will take you to your private 
messaging center. <BR>
</DIV>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Sending</B> - There are three primary ways to send a private message.&nbsp; First,
  you may go your private messaging center and click <U>New Post</U>.&nbsp; Secondly, 
you may click <U>Post Reply</U> from a private message you are reading.&nbsp; 
Finally, you may click the <B><U>PM</U></B> link on any user's profile or post.

  The posting form is identical to the normal posting form with a few 
exceptions: <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Username</B> - The username of the person you want to 
receive the message.&nbsp; If you are replying to a PM, or clicked the 
<B><U>PM</U></B> link in someone's profile, this field will be automatically 
filled for you. <BR>
  <BR>
  Additionally, PMs may not be <B>Sticky Topics</B>, 
<B>Announcements</B>, or contain <B>Polls</B>.
  <LI>
  <DIV class=body3><B>Receiving</B> - There are three ways that one may be notified of a new private message.&nbsp;
  Most obvious is the Private message link at the top of every page.&nbsp;
  It will display <U>You have X new message(s)</U>, where X is the number of new 
messages you have.&nbsp; You may click this link to take you to your <B>Inbox</B>. 
<BR>
  <BR>
  You may be informed of new PMs by an email sent to the email address 
your username is registered to.&nbsp; You may also be informed of a new PM by means 
of a small window that pops up while you are viewing the board.&nbsp; Email and 
pop-up notification will contain a link to your <B>Inbox</B>.&nbsp; Email and pop-up 
notification may be enabled/disabled in your <B>Profile</B> (for more 
information, see <A class="linkage" href="#sec46">Profile Settings</A>) 
<BR>
  <BR>
  Sometimes you may be informed of a new PM, but when you go to your 
Inbox, there is no new message.&nbsp; This is not a bug, it simply means that the 
sender must have deleted the PM before you read it.&nbsp; For more information, see 
<A class=linkage href="phpBB_2_0_Users_Guide.html#section4_3_3">The Outbox</A>. <BR>
  You may delete messages by selecting them and clicking 
<U>Delete Marked</U>.&nbsp; Alternatively, you may delete all messages by clicking 
<U>Delete All</U>.&nbsp; You may also sort/display messages by age by using the 
dropdown list box in the upper right corner.</DIV>
  <LI>
  <DIV class=body3><B>The 
Outbox</B> - When you send a PM, the message goes to your <B>Outbox</B>.&nbsp; It remains in the Outbox until the recipient visits his/her Inbox, at which point it is moved from your Outbox to their Inbox.&nbsp; While the message remains in your Outbox you may edit or delete your post if you like.&nbsp; The message remains in your control until it is received.</DIV>
  <LI><B>The 
Savebox</B> - The Savebox is provided as a place to keep important PMs.&nbsp; Often
  it is used to save valuable messages from the Inbox, and then you can use
  the <U>Delete All</U> function to discard the rest. <BR>
  <BR>
  You may save 
messages in your Inbox by selecting the messages (with the checkboxes next to 
each message) and clicking <U>Save Marked</U>.

<h2><A href="#TOC41" name="SEC41">2.4 Usergroups</A></h2>
<P><B>Usergroups</B> are a powerful feature of phpBB 2.0.0.&nbsp; They allow moderator 
permissions, private permissions, and any other special user settings to be 
granted to multiple people.&nbsp; This makes it easy to change settings for a group 
that has things in common without having to edit each user's individual 
permissions.&nbsp; It is also possible to make the <B>Group Moderator </B>(controls group membership) someone who is not an administrator, granting
power to users without leaving your board's administration panel vulnerable.<BR>
</P>
<OL>
  <LI><B>Joining a group</B> - There are two ways to join a group.&nbsp; First, you may be added to
  the group by the group moderator.&nbsp; This is not controlled by the user,
  but by the group moderator through the group control panel.&nbsp; This
  is the only way to become a member of a <B>Closed</B> or <B>Hidden</B> group. <BR>
  <BR>
  To join an 
open group, click the small <U>Usergroups</U> link at the top of any page. 
<BR>
  <BR>
  Choose the group to join from the <B>Join a Group</B> dropdown list 
shown, and click <U>View Information</U>.&nbsp; This will take you to the <B>Group 
Control Panel</B>.&nbsp; Click <U>Join Group</U> to request membership in the group.&nbsp; 
The <B>Group Moderator</B> will receive an email informing them of the request, which they must approve
  before you become a member of the group.&nbsp;.
  <LI><B>Moderating a Group</B> - For each group, there is one <B>Group Moderator</B>.&nbsp; The group 
moderator may control membership to the group by adding and removing members.&nbsp; 
They may also control the <B>Group Type</B>.&nbsp; The group moderator is specified 
in the admin panel.&nbsp; For more information, see <A class="linkage" href="#sec16">Group Administration</A>.
  <LI><B>Adding Members</B> - To add members to a group, go to the <B>Group Control 
Panel</B>.&nbsp; In the lower right corner, there is a text field.&nbsp; Enter the 
username to add, and click <U>Add Member</U>.&nbsp; Additionally, you may use <U>Find 
a username</U> if you are not sure of the name of the user to add.
  <LI><B>Approving Members</B> - To approve a user's membership to a group, go to the <B>Group 
Control Panel</B>.&nbsp; Look at the bottom of the page at the <B>Pending Members</B> 
section.&nbsp; Check the box next to the member(s) to approve and click <U>Approve 
Selected</U>.&nbsp; You may similarly select and deny a user's membership to the 
group. <BR>
  <BR>
  When a user requests to join a group, email will be sent to the 
group moderator with a link to the <B>Group Control Panel</B>.&nbsp; This allows the 
group moderator to be notified, speeding the approval process.
  <LI><B>Removing Members</B> - To remove members from a group, go to the <B>Group Control 
Panel</B>.&nbsp; Check the boxes next to the names of members to remove, and click 
<U>Remove Selected</U>.

<h2><A href="#TOC42" name="SEC42">2.5 Searching</A></h2>
<P>With PNphpBB2 you have the option of using one of the optional search includes
that work with the postnuke search function and using the built in search
function of the forum. The following information is related to the built
in serach function of PNphpBB2.<BR>
PNphpBB2 has a built in search system that will allow you to find topics
you are interested in.&nbsp; To get to the search page, click the small
<U>Search</U> link at 
the top of any page. <BR>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3><A href="#TOC43" name="SEC43">2.5.1 Search Query</A></h3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV class=body3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Search for Keywords</B>
- You may search for words in the 
content of topics.&nbsp; Enter the words to search for into the text field.&nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>
If you select <B>Search for any terms or use query as entered</B>, then 
topic containing ANY of the words you entered will be displayed.&nbsp; You may use 
the <B>AND</B>, <B>OR</B>, and <B>NOT</B> operators to indicate which words you 
want to search for.&nbsp; Use <B>AND</B> to indicate that multiple words MUST be 
found.&nbsp; Use <B>OR</B> to indicate that a word is optional/alternate.&nbsp; Use 
<B>NOT</B> to indicate that a word should not be present in the topics 
displayed. <BR>
<BR>
If you select <B>Search for all terms</B>, only topics 
containing all of the words in the query will be displayed.&nbsp; Selecting this 
option has effects comparable to using <B>Search for any terms or use query as 
entered</B>, with the <B>AND</B> operator between each term. <BR>
<BR>
You may use 
the asterisk(*) wildcard character to broaden your search.&nbsp; The asterisk will 
match any number of characters.&nbsp; So <I>*cheese*</I> will match <I>cheese</I>, 
<I>cheesewheel</I>, <I>wheelcheese</I>, or <I>wheelcheesewheel</I>.&nbsp; Likewise 
<I>cheese*fudge</I> will match <I>cheesefudge</I>, <I>cheeseyfudge</I>, or 
<I>cheese597fudge</I>. <BR>
<BR>
To increase the speed and decrease the overhead 
of the search utility, only words may be searched for.&nbsp; Phrases (such as "cheese 
wheel") may not be searched for, except by their component words.&nbsp; The minimum 
size for words is four characters, and the maximum size is twenty characters.&nbsp; 
Any non-alphanumeric character (e.g. white space and punctuation) is a word 
boundary.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Search for Author</B> - You may search for posts by post 
author.&nbsp; Simply enter the author's username into this text field.&nbsp; You may use 
the asterisk(*) wildcard in author's names to broaden your search.&nbsp; Again, the 
asterisk will match any number of characters.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sort by</B> - This will allow you to specify how search results are 
organized.&nbsp; You may sort by Post Time, Post Subject, Topic Title, Author, or 
Forum.&nbsp; The sort may be in ascending or descending order alphabetically (or 
chronologically where appropriate) <BR>

  The text &quot;Moved: &quot; will appear in front of the shadow topic in
  the old forum.&nbsp; A shadow topic will not be marked <B>unread</B> when new replies are posted to the topic, so it 
should eventually move down the forum as new topics are made and replied to.&nbsp;

  Suppose there was a topic titled "What kinds of cheese do you like?" in 
a forum named <I>General Discussion</I>.&nbsp; Suppose that a moderator moved that 
topic to the <I>Cheese Discussion</I> forum, and left a shadow topic.&nbsp; In the
